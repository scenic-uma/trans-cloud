            The diversity in the way in which different cloud providers offer
            their services, give their SLAs, present their QoS, or support
            different technologies complicates the portability and

            Cloud Computing has experienced a growth in the
            demand for its services, with a significant
            increase in its popularity. The
            Cloud promotes access on demand to a
            large number of resources throughout
            three main service models, namely
            <strong>IaaS</strong>,
            <strong>PaaS</strong>, and
            <strong>SaaS</strong>
            which allow cloud providers to offer
            a set of useful features for current
            IT requirements of the sector, among
            which we find scalability and elasticity.
            Given the interest in this computing
            model durint last years.
            Vendors have implemented their
            solutions by developing their own cloud
            service layers, with custom APIs that
            expose their resources. Most of these
            providers offer a set of similar services
            as regards functionality, but developed
            according to their own specifications,
            This heterogeneity differences is now
            giving rise to problems of interoperability
            and portability between the different
            providers's clouds. </p>

            <p align="justify">In order to mitigate this heterogeneity and
            find a vendor-agnostic solution, independent
            tools and frameworks have
            emerged with the goal of integrating, under
            a single interface and, the services of multiple
            public and private providers, promoting an aplication modeling
            to formlize the application descriptions, such as

              In a very short time, the aforementioned platforms have
              evolved according to the way in which users
              can take advantage of integrated cloud services
              to expose and run their systems. Terms such as
              <ins><em>multi-cloud</em></ins>, <ins><em>cross-cloud</em></ins>,
              <ins><em>federated clouds</em></ins>,
              or<ins> <em>inter-clouds</em></ins>, have been used for
              deployment platforms with the ability to distribute
              modules of an application using services from
              different providers. The main differences between
              these approaches lie in the different ways of handling
              the connections between modules deployed on different
              platforms. However, in all these attempts, platforms
              allow operating simultaneously with a single level of
              service to deploy applications, i.e., all the components
              of an application are deployed either at the IaaS level
              or all at the PaaS level.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this scenario, with the goal of unifying cloud services,
              a second dimension is proposed by trans-cloud, in which deployment tools
              integrate IaaS and PaaS levels under a single interface.
              Then, this will allow developers to deploy their applications,
              combining services offered by providers at any of these levels.
              Following the evolution in terminology, multi-/cross-/inter-cloud,
              trans-cloud is envisioned like a management tools without the limitations
              it currently faces. The idea behind trans-cloud is to be able to
              build our applications by using available services and resources
              offered by different providers, at the IaaS, PaaS or SaaS levels,
              indistinctly and in combination, using virtual machines,
              containers and other services, according to our
              needs and preferences.

              and their required resources, indistinctly
